Using this format is supposed to be intuitive, each book will contain chapters, each chapter is a question. Using R bookdown will allow us to show the questions data and principles through both explanations and visualization. Good luck! Guy.

True or false, and explain: the data show that the publics health got worse over the period 1970-2000. 2.2 Answer FALSE Explain: Although the data points towards an overall increase in deaths, it fails to show weather the publics health got worse over that time period. An absolute growth (from 1.9 million to 2.4 million) does not suggest a relative growth. It is safe to assume that the population got bigger as well, which can explain the increase in absolute number of deaths. Lets look at an example of relative and absolute numbers (the population number is just for example): As we can see, although the absolute number of deaths shows an increase of 25%, the relative deaths per population shows a decrease, which contradicts the conclusion that the publics health has got worse. Lets look at the relative numbers: "],["set-a-question-3.html", "3 Set A question 3 3.1 Question 3.2 Answer", " 3 Set A question 3 (Page 21) 3.1 Question Polio is an infectious disease; for example, it seemed to spread when children went swimming together. The NFIP study was not done blind: could that bias the results? Discuss briefly 3.2 Answer Yes, that could create a bias. A study which was not done blind (meaning: the subjects were chosen, not randomly) could have a number of biases for/against the vaccine. If we were to choose children that engage in activites (like swimming) that increased their chances of getting the virus, it would have been a bias against the vaccine. "],["set-a-question-4.html", "4 Set A Question 4 4.1 Question 4.2 Answer", " 4 Set A Question 4 (page 21) 4.1 Question The Salk vaccine field trials were conducted only in certain experimental areas (school districts), selected by the Public Health Service in consulatation with local officials. In these areas, there were about 3 million children in grades 1,2 or 3; and there were about 11 millions children in those grades in the U.S. In the experimental areas, the incidence of polio was about 25% higher than in the rest of the country. Did the Salk vaccine field trials cause children to get polio instead of preventing it? 4.2 Answer NO. Higher rates of polio can be explained by other factors. The specific districts that were chosen were those with higher risk of polio to begin with, which explains the higher rates of polio in those areas. This is a good example of the importance of controlled experiments - factors like higher risk of polio, in an uncontrolled experiment, couldve suggested false conclusions. Conducting the experiment in a controlled manner reduces the chance of having those kind of factors. "],["set-a-question-7.html", "5 Set A Question 7 5.1 Question 5.2 Answer", " 5 Set A Question 7 (page 22) 5.1 Question In a clinical trial, data collection usually starts at baseline, when the subjects are recruited into the trial but before they are assigned to treatment or control. Data collection continues until the end of followup. Two clinical trials on prevention of heart attacks report baseline data on smoking, shown below. In one of these trials, the randomization did not work. Which one, and why? 5.2 Answer Lets see the data first: ## Treatment Control ## Number of people 1012 997 ## Percent who smoked 49.3% 69% ## Treatment Control ## Number of people 995 1017 ## Percent who smoked 59.3% 59% As said in the question - the data should show an equal amount of smokers in each group (treatment and control), in order to have an un-biased experiment. As we cann see in the second trial - the percent of smokers in each group is similar (59.3% in the treatment group, 59.3% in the control group), but in the first trial - there are more smokers (69%) in the control group than in the treatment group (49.3%). The difference in the first trial can cause a bias - smoking might have an effect on the reaction to the treatment or general condition. A good randomization process will result in groups with similar rates of smokers (like the second trial), but the randomization process of the first trial did not work properly and produced a higher rate of smokers in the control group.

However, alcohol consumption is a confounding variable. This means - Alcohol causes liver cancer. Drinking is associated with smoking, and alcohol causes liver cancer. Choose one option, and explain.\" 6.2 Answer The second option. We learned about confounding variables in association with both the cause and the effect we want to test. The confounding variable accounts for some of the effect we test. Drinking is a confounding variable in association to both smoking and cancer - meaning that drinking is associated with smoking, and the effects of drinking (mainly alcohol consumption) cause cancer.

Furthermore, women who have had a spontaneous abortion are more likely to have another. One observational study finds that women who exercise regularly have fewer spontaneous abortions than other women. Can you explain the findings of this study? 7.2 Answer Women who exercise regularly may not have had any spontaneous abortion in the past, otherwise - they would not have continued to exercise regularly. This study can be explained by the selection process between those women: those who exercise regularly are in good health and did not experience spontaneous abortion until now. "],["set-a-question-13.html", "8 Set A question 13 8.1 Question 8.2 Answer", " 8 Set A question 13 (Page 24) 8.1 Question A hypothetical university has two departments, A and B. There are 2,000 male applicants, of whom half apply to each department. There are 1,100 female applicants: 100 apply to department A and 1,000 to department B. Department A admits 60% of the men who apply and 60% of the women. Department B admits 30% of the men who apply and 30% of the women. For each department, the percentage of men admitted equals the percentage of women admitted; this must be so for both departments together. True or false, and explain briefly 8.2 Answer FALSE Lets check how many men and women were admitted: We can see that more men were admitted than women, but lets compare the admission percent (divide by number of men or women): Although each department accepted the same percent, with no regard to men/women applicants, higher percentage of men were admitted due to the higher applications for department A (50% of men) comparing to the womens. Department As admission chances were higher (60%) than department Bs, so a higher percentage of men were admitted. "]]
