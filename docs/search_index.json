There are 2,000 male applicants, of whom half apply to each department. There are 1,100 female applicants: 100 apply to department A and 1,000 to department B. Department A admits 60% of the men who apply and 60% of the women. Department B admits 30% of the men who apply and 30% of the women. For each department, the percentage of men admitted equals the percentage of women admitted; this must be so for both departments together. True or false, and explain briefly 8.2 Answer FALSE Lets check how many men and women were admitted: We can see that more men were admitted than women, but lets compare the admission percent (divide by number of men or women): Although each department accepted the same percent, with no regard to men/women applicants, higher percentage of men were admitted due to the higher applications for department A (50% of men) comparing to the womens. Department As admission chances were higher (60%) than department Bs, so a higher percentage of men were admitted. "]]
