## Question 

"Some studies find an association between liver cancer and smoking. However, alcohol consumption is a confounding variable. This means -

1. Alcohol causes liver cancer.
2. Drinking is associated with smoking, and alcohol causes liver cancer.

Choose one option, and explain."

## Answer

**The second option.**

We learned about **confounding variables** in association with both the cause and the effect we want to test. The confounding variable accounts for some of the effect we test. Drinking is a confounding variable in association to both smoking and cancer - meaning that drinking is associated with smoking, and the effects of drinking (mainly alcohol consumption) cause cancer.
